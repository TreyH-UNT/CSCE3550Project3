# CSCE3550Project3
This is the project 3 bulked up JWKS server. This is an extension of project 2. ChatGPT was used to assist with this project. I used ChatGPT to help me with encrypting and decrypting the private keys using AES. I also used it to help with implementing the POST:/register endpoint, hashing passwords with Argon2 then storing them in the database, and storing auth logs in the database. An example of the prompts I used to get results is "Here is the code I am working with: (insert project 2 code here). I would like to encrypt the private keys in the database using symmetric AES encryption. I have a NOT_MY_KEY variable defined in my code that I would like to use for the encryption and decryption with AES." Another example is "I would like to implement a POST:/register endpoint that: (insert requirements from project page here)". Some of the responses I received caused issues/errors in my code, which I relayed back to ChatGPT to help me successfully fix.
